## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2022-06-18

- Refactored the config class to access the Jekyll configuration object only
once so that we're not repeatedly logging to STDOUT about its being accessed.

## [0.2.0] - 2022-06-12

### Changed

- Refactored the `PathBuilder` to check that there's a path to an image passed
to it, otherwise, raise an error. Without a image path, this would be useless.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-06-07

### Added

- Everything
